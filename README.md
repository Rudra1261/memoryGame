Created a memory game using:
- React
- React-Flippy (to flip the cards)
- MaterialUI (for designing purposes)

The project starts with cards showing up in a 4X4 grid all facing downwards. Only two cards are allowed to face frontwards at a time, setTimeout interval for half a second
is set. When two cards match, they keep on facing frontwards. When all the cards match It's written on the top "You've won".
ALSO, Before reloading or navigating away from the page the application asks for your confirmation.
